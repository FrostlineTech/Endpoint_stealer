## About

`Endpoint_Stealer.py` is a concise proof-of-concept that demonstrates how
attackers can exploit a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
policy. It forges an `Origin` header in a single HTTP `POST` request and
prints:

* HTTP status code
* The value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header
* A 500-character snippet of the response body

The script has been fully refactored and annotated, passing **flake8** with
zero linting errors.

## Requirements

This tool is designed with **Kali Linux** in mind and has been tested on the
latest rolling release. It should still run fine on any modern Linux distro (or
macOS/Windows) provided the following prerequisites are met:

* Python ‚â• 3.8
* The packages listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
